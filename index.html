        <h2>Get to know me</h2>
        <p>Some days you'll find me in the water with a toddler and dog by my side. I spend many days outdoors enjoying the sun, playing in water and gardening. Other days you'll find me burried in my computer working on projects. I'm part of an unofficial party planning commity. We have thrown 12 parties already this year with so many more to come! I am the designated cake, cookies and cupcake baker and decorator, as well as balloon artist. I love to create things, from party elements to website elements, I'm your girl. No matter what day it is, I always have a project I'm working on.</p>
        <p>I completed an Associate's of Arts (A.A.) degree and have returned to school to get an Associate's of Computer Science. I'm three courses away from completing a Computer Science Certification while working towards the Associate's of Computer Science. I attended Missouri State University for a couple of semesters after I completed the A.A. but before the pandemic started. I was enrolled at MSU at that time but many things changed in my life, leading me to transfer back to OTC. While at MSU, I completed the following courses: College Algebra, Macro Economics, Micro Economics, Buisness Law, Intro to Accounting, Managerial Accounting, and Risk Management & Insurance.</p>
